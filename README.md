To replicate the snapshot yourself, you need a full node.
The instructions can be found [here](./snapshot/cosmoshub_snapshot.md). #BOUNTY

## plan

If you can read this, we still need to do the following:

 * distill account balance information from the export json file.
   - the tricky part is in finding the rate between ATOMs and staked "shares",
     and accounting for slashing etc.
 * apply the vote information found here to the above according to weighting
   rules based on voting of proposition 69.


## contributions

* 0xAN|Nodes.Guru g1jj32fhrz6awxupdw5na244nxutjk99xk847wm2 for 5/20 export
