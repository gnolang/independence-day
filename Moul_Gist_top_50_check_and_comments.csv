As I already wrote in the comments under https://gist.github.com/moul/b1eab022e24eafa5a158d32ac6f24ab7
"There were some very strange addresses with a lot of Atoms but no tx history on Github, some were clearly airdrop hunters."
I decided to have another look at the list of these 50 highest airdrop receivers and write down my findings.
I started from 50 and worked my way up. Some addresses looked very normal and are not on this file.
"Maybe you want to do something about it, maybe not."
